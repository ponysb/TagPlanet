# Product Features
- **Tab Management**: Easily manage your tabs and tag them, turning your browser into a dashboard.
- **Recent Visits**: Displays the last 10 websites visited at the top, so you can easily recover any tabs you accidentally closed.
- **Tab Bar Management**: If you have too many websites open in your browser, the default tab bar can get too crowded. Tag Planet uses a vertical layout, allowing you to click directly to jump to a tab.
